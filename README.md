# Web application

This application's purpose is to track series that you watched simply by adding them and clicking on a button. 

The frontend of this application is developed with ReactJS technology and it consist of a few components.
Main components are the registration, login and series component.
I used NodeJS and MongoDB database to build the backend part of this application.
